    <h1>The Best Movies According to Valdirlei Jose</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all times.</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Interstellar </h3>
    <p>Christopher Nolan’s "Interstellar," about astronauts traveling to the other end of the galaxy to find a new home to replace humanity’s despoiled home-world, is frantically busy and earsplittingly loud. It uses booming music to jack up the excitement level of scenes that might not otherwise excite. It features characters shoveling exposition at each other for almost three hours, and a few of those characters have no character to speak of: they’re mouthpieces for techno-babble and philosophical debate. And for all of the director’s activism on behalf of shooting on film, the tactile beauty of the movie’s 35mm and 65mm textures isn’t matched by a sense of composition. The camera rarely tells the story in Nolan’s movies. More often it illustrates the screenplay, and there are points in this one where I felt as if I was watching the most expensive NBC pilot ever made.</p>
    <h3>Life Is Beautiful</h3>
    <p>The film was praised by the Italian press, with Benigni treated as a "national hero."[14] Pope John Paul II, who received a private screening with Benigni, placed it in his top five favourite films.[14] It holds a "Fresh" 80% approval rating on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 92 reviews with an average rating of 7.50/10. The site's consensus reads: "Benigni's earnest charm, when not overstepping its bounds into the unnecessarily treacly, offers the possibility of hope in the face of unflinching horror".</p>
    <h3>Avatar</h3>
    <p>"Avatar" is not simply a sensational entertainment, although it is that. It's a technical breakthrough. It has a flat-out Green and anti-war message. It is predestined to launch a cult. It contains such visual detailing that it would reward repeating viewings. It invents a new language, Na'vi, as "Lord of the Rings" did, although mercifully I doubt this one can be spoken by humans, even teenage humans. It creates new movie stars. It is an Event, one of those films you feel you must see to keep up with the conversation.</p>
